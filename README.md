# BrickBreakerGame-Java
It is a traditional brick breaker game in which number of bricks increase with every level you pass.

--> Game starts with 10 bricks(2*5) with every level you pass a row of 5 bricks increase.

--> Every time you break a brick, score increases by 5;

--> You get 3 lives where every level is a checkpoint; every time you lose a life, you reach the beginning of the level and lose score.
